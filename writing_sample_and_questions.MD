Hey team!

I just got done with the analysis you asked for. It seems we're missing some data from 2021 forward. 
Are you aware of an outage or the way our data has been handled? I was able to process everything we've got up to ~ 3/1/2021. 
Aside from the missing 3 years worth of data, our pipelines indicated that there is quite a bit of duplicate or missing data from various files. 
I can elaborate better in person as the QA files formats are not really intended for stakeholders. 
With the vast amount of dupes and missing field data, I would be hesitant to give you the query results without a huge asterisk. 
Would it be possible for us to delay your presentation until I can get with my team to better understand why the data is the way it is? 


Thanks,

Jake



1. What questions do you have about the data?
2. How did you discover the data quality issues?
What do you need to know to resolve the data quality issues?
What other information would you need to help you optimize the data assets you're trying to create?
What performance and scaling concerns do you anticipate in production and how do you plan to address them?
